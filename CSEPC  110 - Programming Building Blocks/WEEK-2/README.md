# WEEK-2 NOTEs

To place name for our variables we have two options

```
# We can't use spaces for long names
this_is_a_long_name_for_a_variable

# We can also use the camel case option wich is used in other lenguages like javascript too
thisIsaLongNameForaVariable
```

To place notes in our code we can use this method:

```
# This is only a comment and do nothing in your code.
# It helps to document code and make it easy to understand to others
# Also it helps to try cases to debug
```
